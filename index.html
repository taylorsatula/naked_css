			<h2><span>Where did the design go</span></h2> 
				<p>The website you just came from <em>is not broken</em>, the owner of it has decided to participate in Naked CSS Day 2014! Naked CSS Day is a event that is held once per year to celebrate good &amp; well planned design. The website you arrived from will be back to its normal state tomorrow.</p>
			</section>
			
			
			<section id="what">
				<h2><span>What does that mean</span></h2> 
				<p>The idea behind this event is to promote Web Standards. Plain and simple. This includes proper use of html, semantic markup, a good hierarchy structure, and of course, a good 'ol play on words. It's time to show off your &lt;body&gt; for what it really is.</p> 
			</section>
			
			
			<section id="how">
				<h2><span>How to Participate</span></h2>
				<p>Complete the super quick <a href="support/">signup form</a> to be alerted before April 9<sup>th</sup> of Naked CSS Day, this will give you time to add the correct scripts to your website, be added to the list of sites participating, and also alert your visitors beforehand if you feel that is necessary. Then on April 9th, simply comment out your stylesheets or use a provided script, stripping it entirely of its cosmetic design.<br><br>
				A list has lovingly been put together for developers detailing more information about some <a href="developers/">suggested codes &amp; scripts</a> to use during the event.</p>

				<blockquote cite="http://people.opera.com/howcome/">
					This [Naked CSS Day] is a fun idea, fully in line with the reasons for creating CSS in the first place. While most designers are attracted by the extra presentational capabilities, saving HTML from becoming a presentational language was probably a more important motivation for most people who participated in the beginning.
