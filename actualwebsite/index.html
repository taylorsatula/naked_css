				<h2>Where did the design go</h2> 
					<p>The website you just came from <em>is not broken</em>, the owner of it has decided to participate in Naked CSS Day 2014! Naked CSS Day is a event that is held once per year to celebrate good &amp; well planned design. The website you arrived from will be back to its normal styled state tomorrow. Keep calm and carry on.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section id="what">
					<h2>What does that mean</h2> 
					<p>The idea behind this event is to promote Web Standards. Plain and simple. This includes proper use of html, semantic markup, a good hierarchy structure, and of course, a good 'ol play on words. It's time to show off your &lt;body&gt; for what it really is.</p>

					<h2>How to Participate</h2>
					<p><a href="support/">Enter your email address</a> to be alerted before April 9<sup>th</sup> of Naked CSS Day, this will give you time to get your name in our official list of participants.<br><br>
					Then on April 9th, simply remove all CSS from your website, stripping it entirely of its design.<br><br>
					Also, Developers, I have put together a nice list of <a href="developers/">suggested codes &amp; scripts</a>.</p>

					<h2>Famous Words</h2>
					<blockquote cite="http://people.opera.com/howcome/">
						<q>This is a fun idea, fully in line with the reasons for creating CSS in the first place. While most designers are attracted by the extra presentational capabilities, saving HTML from becoming a presentational language was probably a more important motivation for most people who participated in the beginning.</q>
