	<h2>Where did the design go?</h2>
	The idea behind this event is to promote Web Standards. Plain and simple. This includes proper use of (x)html,semantic markup,a good hierarchy structure, and of course,a good 'ol play on words. It's time to show off your &lt;body&gt; .<br><br>

	<blockquote cite="http://people.opera.com/howcome/">
		<p>This is a fun idea, fully in line with the reasons for creating CSS in the first place. 
		While most designers are attracted by the extra presentational capabilities, saving HTML from becoming a presentational language 
		was probably a more important motivation for most people who participated in the beginning. - <cite>H&aring;kon Wium Lie</cite></p><br><br>
