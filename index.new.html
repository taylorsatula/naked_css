                            &#8220;This is a fun idea, fully in line with the reasons for creating CSS in the first place. 
                            While most designers are attracted by the extra presentational capabilities, saving HTML from becoming a presentational language 
                            was probably a more important motivation for most people who participated in the beginning.&#8221;
